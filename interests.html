                <p>Infinity Train is one of my favorite shows due to it's good character development through the show, the beautiful animation, and the emphasis it puts on change.
                    This show has inspired many hours of designing and drawing, and excites me with the unique storytelling and mysteries it presents it's audience with.
                    While the show may have been cancelled, I hope for it's return to television someday.

                    Star Wars will be something I continue to appreciate, for the excitement it has and will give me in the future.

                <p>Marvel has inspired me in many ways, but one of the most important ways is teaching me that anything is possible. 
                    There are many types of people in the world, and it's important to recognize the influence you have on the lives of others.
                    When you look at yourself, you need to determine for yourself if you are going to choose to help others or not every day of your life.
                    Marvel reminds me that these choices and changes can happen, but that's up to you if you choose to make those actions.
