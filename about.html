                <p id="row_1_info">I have lived in Twin Falls, Idaho for most of my life and have enjoyed being a part of the community and exploring the beautiful places nearby.
                    Visiting the Perrine Bridge, exploring around the Shoshone Falls, and spending many hours at the Public Library have been some of my favorite activities.
                    Growing up in Twin Falls, I have also had the priveledge to gain my education from the public schools and attending many clubs and events.</p>

                <h2>August 2020-22</h2>
                <p id="row_1_info">After graduating from Twin Falls High School in May of 2020, 
                    I had the incredible oppertunity to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Arkansas, Little Rock Mission.
                    Serving a Mission helped me to learn how to serve others through community projects, teaching principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
                    and how to be a leader through communicating and listening to the needs of those around me.
                    I will not forget these two years of my life dedicated to serving my Savior.

                <h2>September - December 2022</h2>
                <p id="row_1_info">For a few months after my Mission and before my time in College, I was fortunate to work at Chick-fil-a to help fund my education.
                    During this time I learned how to work with a team, communicate issues, and take responsibility for tasks assigned to me.
                    I also learned many different skills and possitions while working in a fast pace environment.
                    I am grateful for the time I had to work with such skillful people and become friends with them.

                <h2>January 2023 - December 2025</h2>
                <p id="row_1_info">Currently I am attending college at Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYUI) in Rexburg, Idaho.
                    I have enjoyed making connections with my roommates, church members, and classmates.
                    Studying has been exciting, and I am enjoying learning new skills, and growing my abilites in the many different faucets of technology.
                    My major is Web Development and Design, though I have spent time in the Interedisciplinary and Computer Science majors as well.
                    Web Design is a fun way to express your ideas and show creativity, and is one of my many skills.
                    I pride myself in having many abilities and interests that I hope to grow in alongside my Web programming.
