                <p id="row_1_info">HTML is a skill that I have been improving since Highschool. 
                    I enjoy programming with it because of the structure it provides.
                    One of the coolest things I did with HTML was write up a website with only a Google Doc and a smart phone while I was on the mission.
                    I used that file and sent it home as a weekly email.</p>

                <p id="row_1_info">I've always loved art.
                    As long as I could find a pen and some paper I'd be drawing nonstop wherever I went. 
                    In Middle School, I was given the opportunity to try Photoshop, and stuck with it even though I struggled to understand it at first.
                    It was an amazing experience to combine my love for technology and art by learning how to use it.
                    I continued improving my Photoshop skills through High School, and was able to become Photoshop 2022 Certified on my own free time in College.
                    The ability to use Photoshop is a huge blessing and I hope to keep using and improving it in my life.</p>

                <p id="row_1_info">CSS feels like an extention of my experience in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. 
                    Using CSS, I've been able to make the blocky feel of HTML feel smooth and personal.
                    While I'm not perfect at CSS, I enjoy using it because it makes web designing feel limitless and can bring the message of your webpage together in a cohessive way.
                    I hope to continue perfecting my ability to use CSS and improve the quality of my websites as I continue to do so.</p>
