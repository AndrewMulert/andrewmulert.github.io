            <p>I use Instagram actively to connect with my friends and family. 
                If you want to get in contact with me, the best way would be through my personal account.
                I keep this account private to avoid being spammed by bots on the internet, so it may be a while before I approve any requests.
                My art account however is public, and a great place to visit if you want more examples of the art and concepts I design!
                No matter which account you end up contacting, be sure to let me know why you're messaging and what you thought of my site!

            <p>Facebook is one of the accounts I use to share updates on my life and website as I start to make major changes to it.
                Messages sent here won't reach me immediately as everyone I'm not friends with has to go through an approval process.
                Again, if you contact me through here please be sure to let me know why you're reaching out!

            <p>LinkedIn is another one of the many forms of Social Media that I have an account on.
                I update my resume information on LinkedIn and use it for job hunting.
                Currently, I'm on the search for somewhere to intern at so I can finish my major and join the workforce.
                I would love to become a part of your team!

            <p>The best way to contact me currently is through phone or email.
                But since there are high amounts of scammers and people on the internet that would love to spam me if they got a hold of that information, 
                I will only hand out that information after I have confirmed your identity.
                I plan to add a form here in the future for serious inquiries.
