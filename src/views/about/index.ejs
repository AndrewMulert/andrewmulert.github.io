            <p>I grew up in Twin Falls, Idaho and enjoy being a part of the community. 
                Exploring the natural landmarks like visiting the Perrine Bridge, hiking around the Shoshone Falls, and spending many hours at the public library are some of my favorite activities.
                I have had the privilege of gaining my education from the public school located in Twin Falls and participated in many clubs and events in my free time.</p>

            <p>After graduating from Twin Falls High School in May 2020, 
                I had the incredible opportunity to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Arkansas Little Rock Mission.
                Serving a Mission helped me to grow as a person as I served others through participating in community projects, teaching principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
                and learning how to be a leader through communicating and listening to the needs of those around me.
                I will never forget these two years of my life dedicated to serving my Savior.

            <p>I am currently attending college at Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYU-I) in Rexburg, Idaho.
                During my time here, I have made connections with my roommates, church members, and classmates.
                Spending my time studying, learning new skills, and growing my abilities in the many different facets of technology has been exciting and rewarding.
                My major is Web Development and Design, which I decided on after having spent time in the Interdisciplinary and Computer Science Majors.
                Designing Websites has been a fun way to express my ideas and be creative while using technology.
                I pride myself in having many abilities and interests that I hope to grow in skill alongside my Web programming studies.
