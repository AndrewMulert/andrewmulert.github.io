            <p>HTML is a skill that I have been improving upon since high school. 
                I enjoy programming with it because of the structure it provides to a website that allows everything else to come together.
                One of the coolest things I have created with HTML was typing up a website with only a Google Doc and a smart phone while I was on the mission.
                While I couldn't directly connect a CSS file because everyone would have been opening the file from their downloads folder (something I wasn't too sure would work at the time), 
                I used that file and sent it home as a weekly email.</p>

            <p>I have always loved art.
                As far as I can remember I would be drawing nonstop wherever I went, as long as I could find a pen and some paper. 
                In Middle School, I was given the opportunity to try PhotoShop, and stuck with it even though I struggled to understand it at first.
                It has been an amazing experience to combine my love for technology and art by learning how to apply PhotoShop to my many different ideas.
                I continued improving my PhotoShop skills through high school, and was even able to become PhotoShop 2022 Certified on my own free time in College.
                The ability to use PhotoShop is a huge blessing and I hope to keep using and improving it in my life.</p>

            <p>I enjoy using Adobe Illustrator because the ability to rasterize objects makes it the perfect tool for making logos and designs that can fit multiple displays.
                Making designs and icons is a huge benefit for creativity and building projects, because the perfect design can represent your idea much better than words.
                While I have much to learn about the ins and outs of Adobe Illustrator, I plan to continue my studies and grow my experience in this tool.

            <p>CSS feels like an extension of my experience in PhotoShop and Adobe Illustrator. 
                Using CSS, I've been able to make the blocky feel of HTML feel smooth, personal, and more stunning than before.
                While I'm not perfect at CSS, I enjoy using it because it makes web designing feel limitless and can bring the message of your webpage together in a cohesive way.
                I hope to continue perfecting my ability to use CSS and improve the quality of the websites I work on as I continue to do so.</p>

            <p>Javascript is essential to the functionality of a website, making it so the website can pull from other parts of it and turn on different elements when the website is interacted with.
                Admittedly, I still struggle with JavaScript a lot, getting it to do what I want and remembering the right commands to use still doesn't come naturally to me.
                I have used Javascript on this website and many other school projects, and am still learning how I can continue to apply it in new ways.
